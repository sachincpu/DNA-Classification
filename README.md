<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The completion of the human genome project in the last decade has generated a strong demand in computational analysis techniques in order to fully exploit the acquired human genome database. The human genome project generated a perplexing mass of genetic data which necessitates automatic genome annotation. There is a growing interest in the process of gene finding and gene recognition from DNA sequences. In genetics, a promoter is a segment of a DNA that marks the starting point of transcription of a particular gene. Therefore, recognizing promoters is a one step towards gene finding in DNA sequences. 

In this project, We have designed and developed a machine learning model for DNA sequence classiﬁcation based on presence of promoter sequence using various machine learning algorithms.
